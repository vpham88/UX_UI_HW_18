I enjoy solving unique and complex user problems that requires innovative and outside-of-the-box solutions. 

                <br></br>I enjoy the ideation phase and brainstorming with a team to come up with a new and fun idea for clients. In a team, I am typically the creative or project lead.
                
                <br></br>I am also a life-longer learner and I enjoy learning new things and new ways of accomplishing a task which is why I have enjoyed the UX field. It's always evolving and it challenges you to be more creative with each solution.</p>
